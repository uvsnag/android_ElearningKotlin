        android:text="To avoid bombarding your users with multiple or redundant notifications when you have additional updates, you should consider updating an existing notification rather than issuing a new one, or consider using the inbox-style notification to show conversation updates.  However, if it's necessary to deliver multiple notifications, you should consider grouping those separate notifications into a group (available on Android 7.0 and higher). A notification group allows you to collapse multiple notifications into just one post in the notification drawer, with a summary. The user can then expand the notification to reveal the details for each individual notification.  The user can progressively expand the notification group and each notification within it for more details."></TextView>
